SpringBoot if it is not picking up Controllers or Entities

Spring Boot relies heavily on default configuration. Consider this excerpt from @EnableAutoConfiguration annotation.

The package of the class that is annotated with @EnableAutoConfiguration, usually via @SpringBootApplication, has specific significance and is often used as a 'default'. For example, it will be used when scanning for @Entity classes. It is generally recommended that you place @EnableAutoConfiguration (if you're not using @SpringBootApplication) in a root package so that all sub-packages and classes can be searched.

The same logic implies to @ComponentScan, @EnableJpaRepositories and the above mentioned @EntityScan annotations. So, if you want to take control of component scanning, you should specify base packages explicitly for all of those annotations.

@SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = "com.test")
@EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = "com.test")
@EntityScan(basePackages = "com.test")
public class Application {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
  }
}
